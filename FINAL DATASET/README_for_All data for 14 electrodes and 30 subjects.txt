Each stimuli item remained for 0.5 s with 30 iterations for one session. The inter-stimulus interval was 1.6 s. 
Each subject was instructed to perform 5 sessions. 
1.There are two folder "lying" and "honest" in dataset. In each folder, there are 15 subjects' data.
2. In each subject's folder, there are 5 subfolder containing related data files for 5 sessions. 
3. In each session's folder, there are 3 files in 3 corresponding folder. For example, in the second session for the subject called subject3,
you can open " .\lying\subject3\session2" folder, and you can find three files: irrelevent.txt, probe.txt and target.txt.
4. For each files, such as " .\lying\subject3\session2\irrelevant\irrelevant.txt", it was all the response EEG signal for irrelevant stimuli.
you can use EEGLAB toolbox open it and segment them into many epoched datasets.
