	a function to discretize a data set containing continuous feature vectors.
	The discretization is done using mean+/-alpha*std. For instance if alpha =
	[0 1], a given feature will be discretize in four different (integer)
	values (1, 2, 3 and 4), corresponding to continuously values in the ranges
	[-inf, mean-1*std], [mean-1*std, mean(-0*std)], [mean(+0*std), mean+1*std], [mean+1*std, inf].
	
	Input:
	dataSet: 
	   the data set to be discretized, which is a matrix of feature vectors. 
	   this matrix is a matrix with size [nT,nF+1] where
	          nT          = number of data,
	          nF          = number of features (input dimension),
	          lastcol     = class labels (one per data) 
	alpha:
	   the list of thresholds for discretization (see exemple above)
	
	discreteDataSet: 
	   the discretized data set, with values in 1, 2, 3 ... N 
	   with N depending on the number of thresholds alpha (see exemple above)
